## On Money and Banking:

So, money is a very interesting concept. We use it as an instrument that helps us exchange things of value, and ideally it also serves as a way to store value that can be used at a later time. A problem we're dealing with now though is that because of complicated reasons, we recently moved away from having our monetary instruments be backed by physical things of value, such as gold. Instead, money is not really backed by anything and so now we have to deal with inflation as a never ending issue. This is a huge problem though, one that deserves a critical exploration, which I will leave for another time. What I want to focus on in this post is instead the role banks play in our modern economic systems.
