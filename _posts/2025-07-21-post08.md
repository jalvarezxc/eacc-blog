## On Neutrinos: 

Eric Weinstein brought up neutrinos in a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNjckutR7BE&list=LL&index=9&ab_channel=TheInstituteofArtandIdeas) recently, quipping that we should be glad we can't feel neutrinos in this space "because they're tearing through all of us body and soul." Ironically, he was defending Brian Green and String Theory when he made this remark - pointing out that there is still a lot we don't understand of subatomic particles. This is ironic, by the way, because Eric is known for being very critical of string theory and the scientists behind the long-running scientific effort. Meanwhile, the statement he made regarding the absurd nature of [neutrinos](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/looking-for-neutrinos-natures-ghost-particles-64200742/#:~:text=About%20100%20trillion%20neutrinos%20pass,see%20and%20difficult%20to%20detect.), is a great example of his dramatic way with words. 

I mean, putting aside for a moment the complex details, isn't amazing to contemplate that there are trillions of known particles, with apparently some mass, passing right through our bodies and most of the matter around us?! This is an incredible fact even if it's coming from the same source that gave us *quantum mechanics*. And as Eric Weinstein indicated, it's no wonder that theories like String Theory have imagined worlds within particles to explain some of their perplexing qualities. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed Eric's dramatic quip as it reminded me of the fascinating world of particle physics.
