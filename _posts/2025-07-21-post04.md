## On Energy:

We need better sources of energy. I'm glad to know Biden's agenda considers this an important issue (wrote this during his term). The president's Build Back Better plan, which also focuses on *building*, and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act are good signs that the US government is taking some action on **energy**. Hopefully we can embrace this kind of movement regadless of what polical party is in office, because for the country to be able to defend its ideals of democracy and liberty, to fight climate change, and to solve important issues at home, it needs to not only have a strong economy but it also needs to build faster.

It seems that for now we should focus on moving away from fossil fuels, so a good start may be to use a mix of sources of energy, such as Solar, Wind, Nuclear, and possibly others. At the same time we need to realize that we can't really afford to slow down our energy consumption, but instead we should look to use energy as efficiently as possible. Therefore, we need to continue building things and innovating - there is no going back. We will never give up AC, fast transportation, instant communication, or any basic appliances we are accustomed to. Nor should we ever expect other countries to not want these things, while standing on our pedestals, because we are *now* worried about climate change - regardless of how important this issue is.
