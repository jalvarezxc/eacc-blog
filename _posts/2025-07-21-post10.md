## On Our Purpose:

As the major theme of Ayn Rand's *Fountainhead* and George Hotz recently reminded me, one of the greatest foes we have as humans has always been nature. Nature, and the elements, is something we've always had to battle in our efforts to survive and continue our existence. That is why shelter has always been one of our major concerns - alongside food and water. This is something we should remind ourselves more frequently, especially as we fight over the usual problems such as race, nationality, and religion - to name a few!

Why should we submit to the whims and indiscriminate ways of nature? We have always taken matters into our own hands as we fight against the destructive acts of nature, with reason on our side. So, as we encounter bigger obstacles to our longevity such as, climate change, global pandemics, and threats from outer space, we need to realize that there are ways we can fight back. We can start by finally spreading human life troughout the solar system, and then we can more comfortably take proactive measures to defend our selves against internal and external forces that could threaten humanity. Again, Elon is right about this. We should colonize Mars!
